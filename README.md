# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Final Project

## Due Last day of Class
## First report due Monday Oct 28, 2024

### Build a web app in a team of 4-5

### Requirements:
* Must have user accounts and different user roles (like user/Admin, free/paid, etc)
* Must use a database (you choose)
* Must have interactive UI (of any kind)
* Must use a library or framework not discussed/used in class
* Must use an outside REST API in some way (Outside as in external, like the Reddit API, etc)

* Feel free to build off other projects and frameworks. For example [https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter] is a great starter project that you can build on top of.

### Instructions
Build your team and write a document describing your application to me by Monday Oct 28, 2024. Email this document to me and the TA for this course (Xinhui Chen xic721@lehigh.edu)  I will approve your web application idea. In your paper, include:
* the name of your application
* Name and roles of all your team members
* its functionality (how does it meet each of the requirements listed above - list each requirement along with your will fulfill it)
* user story/use case (what happens when a user visits your application, what can they do, etc)
* technical design (what is your tech stack)


### Final deliverable due end of the semester:
* Codebase in Github Repo
* README describing your project, with all the information outlined above (team members, application name, description, etc). You will also include detailed instructions of how to install and run your application, and what API keys, databases, etc are needed to run your application.
* Final Presentation and Demo
  * You will prepare a 5 minute presentation and demo of your application in class during the last week of classes
